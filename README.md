# Agentic-GitDocs
This application is made up of 2 parts, front end and backend.

**Front End**

This is based on streamlit and helps get user input for the git repository to be analyzed. It also displays the final documentation to the user.

**Back End**

This is a JacLang based application consisting of a number of agents working together to achieve the documentation required.
